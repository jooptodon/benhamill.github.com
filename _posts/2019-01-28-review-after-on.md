I used to review books on [a dedicated Mastodon
account](https://wandering.shop/@benhamill), but I've since wanted to be able to
write a little bit more and also show them to people outside the context of the
fediverse. This was also spurred by the fact that, after moving, I read a ton of
books without keeping up with the reviews, so I'm going to do bunch of catch-up
reviews.

First up is _After On_ by Rob Reid.
